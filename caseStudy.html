<!--Phase 1 Start-->

      <div class="container">
        <div class="row"> <h1>Phase 1: Research</h1></div>
        <div class="row"> <p>I initially conducted some usability tests on the existing website towards the very beginning of our project. But early on we decided to pivot our strategy as we found through these tests that usability wasn’t the main problem. There were however, a myriad of aesthetic issues with the site which we decided to break down with some annotations.
          We then decided to conduct a pair of surveys. The first survey was to gauge familiarity with the organization and determine if people could determine the goals of the foundation. The second was more focused on the individual programs to determine which they were most likely to donate towards. The surveys were very helpful in helping us understand the key problems with the site, and why people were or were not likely to donate to MWSF.
          I also reached out to the organization early on in our research to try to set up a conversation with a stakeholder, but unfortunately was not able to connect.

<!--Phase 2 Start-->

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row"> <h1>Phase 2: Definition & Ideation</h1></div>
      <div class="row"> <p>The primary issue we synthesized from our research is that users were not clear on what the primary goal of MWSF was. From this realization, we knew that clear and concise communication on our redesign was going to be very important. We would also need to rework some of the information architecture.

        We decided to do a card sorting exercise to work on some issues we found with the primary navigation. From there we were able to devise a new sitemap. 
        
        On the desktop view of the original site there are 3 different “Donate” buttons, and they were oddly placed. This is something we knew needed work, as generating more donations was our primary goal.
